## üöÄ Project Overview

**Project Name**: SpectraCache

**Description**: Distributed in-memory cache system with advanced data structures and optimizations for specific enterprise use cases, offering a specialized alternative to Redis and similar solutions.

## ü§î Why Not Simply Use Redis?

| Feature Area | SpectraCache Advantage |
|--------------|------------------------|
| **Consistency & Durability** | Stronger guarantees for sectors requiring strict consistency |
| **Domain Specialization** | Data structures and algorithms optimized for specific sectors |
| **Governance & Compliance** | Native features for regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) |
| **Extensibility** | More accessible plugin and extension system |

## üéØ Primary Use Cases

- **Financial Sector** 
  - High-frequency trading
  - Real-time fraud detection

- **Healthcare**
  - Temporary storage of patient data with HIPAA compliance

- **E-commerce**
  - Session and inventory management with high concurrency

- **IoT**
  - Event processing and aggregation for millions of devices

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Main Components

1. **Cache Core**: Central storage and retrieval engine
2. **Coordination Service**: Node management, sharding, and rebalancing
3. **Access APIs**: Client interfaces for multiple languages
4. **Administration Dashboard**: Interface for monitoring and configuration
5. **Persistence Layer**: Mechanisms to ensure data durability

### Distributed Topology

*Architecture diagram would be placed here*

## üìä Fundamental Data Structures

### Base Structures

- **Distributed Hash Tables**: O(1) access with dynamic redistribution
- **B+ Trees**: Indexing for range queries
- **Bloom Filters**: Fast membership checks
- **Skip Lists**: Ordered lists with rapid access

### Specialized Structures

- **Time Series**: Optimized for high-frequency time series data
- **In-Memory Graphs**: For complex relationships and traversal queries
- **HyperLogLog++**: Advanced probabilistic counters
- **Spatial**: R-tree indexes for geospatial data

## üîç Differential Features

### Consistency Mechanisms
- **Consensus Protocols**: RAFT or Paxos implementation
- **Multi-key Transactions**: Atomic operations across multiple keys
- **Quorum Levels**: Configurable by operation or dataset

### Security and Compliance
- **Multilayer Encryption**: At rest, in transit, and during processing
- **Granular Access Control**: RBAC with field or record-level policies
- **Complete Auditing**: Logging of all operations for compliance

### Performance
- **Hot/Cold Data Separation**: Intelligent storage tier policies
- **Adaptive Compression**: Algorithms that adjust to data type
- **Predictive Prefetching**: Based on access patterns and ML

## üíª Technical Implementation

### Recommended Technologies
- **Main Language**: Rust (performance and memory safety)
- **Supported Languages**: SDKs for Java, C#, Python, Go, JavaScript
- **Persistent Storage**: RocksDB or similar technology
- **Coordination Service**: etcd or ZooKeeper

### Code Organization (DDD)
- **Core Domain**: Fundamental data structures and algorithms
- **Distribution Domain**: Sharding, replication, and consensus
- **Access Domain**: Client protocols and authentication
- **Monitoring Domain**: Metrics, alerts, and observability

## üìÖ Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP (3 months)
- Single-node core with basic data structures
- REST API and client in one language
- Basic administrative dashboard

### Phase 2: Distribution (3 months)
- Sharding and partitioning
- Replication for high availability
- SDK expansion for more languages

### Phase 3: Enterprise (6 months)
- Advanced security and compliance
- Specialized data structures
- Integrations with enterprise ecosystems

## üìà Success Metrics
- **Performance**: Latency below 1ms for simple operations
- **Scalability**: Linear up to at least 100 nodes
- **Durability**: No data loss even in catastrophic failures
- **Usability**: Integration time less than 1 day for developers

## üíº Business Considerations

### Licensing Model
- **Open Core**: Basic core open source with paid enterprise features
- Options for on-premise or SaaS licensing

### Initial Target Audiences
- Financial companies with high-performance requirements
- Healthcare systems with compliance needs
- E-commerce platforms with seasonal peaks
