# Distributed Specialized Cache System

## 1. Project Overview
- **Project Name**: SpectraCache
- **Description**: Distributed in-memory cache system with advanced data structures and optimizations for specific enterprise use cases, offering a specialized alternative to Redis and similar solutions.

## 2. Motivation and Use Cases

### 2.1 Why Not Simply Use Redis?
- **Consistency and durability**: Stronger guarantees for sectors requiring strict consistency
- **Domain specialization**: Data structures and algorithms optimized for specific sectors
- **Governance and compliance**: Native features for regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- **Extensibility**: More accessible plugin and extension system

### 2.2 Primary Use Cases
- **Financial sector**: High-frequency trading, real-time fraud detection
- **Healthcare**: Temporary storage of patient data with HIPAA compliance
- **E-commerce**: Session and inventory management with high concurrency
- **IoT**: Event processing and aggregation for millions of devices

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Main Components
- **Cache Core**: Central storage and retrieval engine
- **Coordination Service**: Node management, sharding, and rebalancing
- **Access APIs**: Client interfaces for multiple languages
- **Administration Dashboard**: Interface for monitoring and configuration
- **Persistence Layer**: Mechanisms to ensure data durability

### 3.2 Distributed Topology

## 4. Fundamental Data Structures

### 4.1 Base Structures
- **Distributed Hash Tables**: O(1) access with dynamic redistribution
- **B+ Trees**: Indexing for range queries
- **Bloom Filters**: Fast membership checks
- **Skip Lists**: Ordered lists with rapid access

### 4.2 Specialized Structures
- **Time Series**: Optimized for high-frequency time series data
- **In-Memory Graphs**: For complex relationships and traversal queries
- **HyperLogLog++**: Advanced probabilistic counters
- **Spatial**: R-tree indexes for geospatial data

## 5. Differential Features

### 5.1 Consistency Mechanisms
- **Consensus Protocols**: RAFT or Paxos implementation
- **Multi-key Transactions**: Atomic operations across multiple keys
- **Quorum Levels**: Configurable by operation or dataset

### 5.2 Security and Compliance
- **Multilayer Encryption**: At rest, in transit, and during processing
- **Granular Access Control**: RBAC with field or record-level policies
- **Complete Auditing**: Logging of all operations for compliance

### 5.3 Performance
- **Hot/Cold Data Separation**: Intelligent storage tier policies
- **Adaptive Compression**: Algorithms that adjust to data type
- **Predictive Prefetching**: Based on access patterns and ML

## 6. Technical Implementation

### 6.1 Recommended Technologies
- **Main Language**: Rust (performance and memory safety)
- **Supported Languages**: SDKs for Java, C#, Python, Go, JavaScript
- **Persistent Storage**: RocksDB or similar technology
- **Coordination Service**: etcd or ZooKeeper

### 6.2 Code Organization (DDD)
- **Core Domain**: Fundamental data structures and algorithms
- **Distribution Domain**: Sharding, replication, and consensus
- **Access Domain**: Client protocols and authentication
- **Monitoring Domain**: Metrics, alerts, and observability

- **Scalability**: Linear up to at least 100 nodes
- **Durability**: No data loss even in catastrophic failures
- **Usability**: Integration time less than 1 day for developers

## 9. Business Considerations

### 9.1 Licensing Model
- **Open Core**: Basic core open source with paid enterprise features
- Options for on-premise or SaaS licensing

### 9.2 Initial Target Audiences
